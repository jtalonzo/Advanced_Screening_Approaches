s from solutions of spent nuclear fuel. This separation of actinides reduces the hazards associated with spent nuclear fuel, such as its radiotoxicity, volume and the amount of time required for its radioactivity to return to naturally occurring levels. Separation of actinides from environmental water systems is also brie y discussed. The actinide elements typically found in spent nuclear fuel include uranium, pluto nium and the minor actinides americium, neptunium and curium. Separation methods for uranium and plutonium are reasonably well established. On the other hand separation of the minor actinides from lanthanide ssion products also present in spent nuclear fuel is an ongoing challenge and an area of active research. Several separation methods for selective removal of these actinides from spent nuclear fuel will be described. These separation methods include solvent extraction, which is the most commonly used method for radiochemical separations, as well as the less developed bu
t promising use of adsorption and ionexchange materials. Crown Copyright 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Contents 1.

All rights reserved. J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 267 Fig. 1. Approximate composition of spent nuclear fuel. 1. Introduction Currently, nuclear power accounts for app
rox. 11 of all elec tricity generated worldwide. There are 434 nuclear power plants currently in operation in 30 countries around the world and a further 72 power plants were under construction as of the end of 2013 1. Management of spent nuclear fuel is thus an impor tant issue that will increase in relevance if nuclear power becomes more widely adopted internationally. The two longterm options for management of spent nuclear fuel are 1 storage in a deep geo logical repository or 2 separation and recycling of the actinide elements. In the rst scenario, deep geological storage, the spent nuclear fuel will remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years 2. Ensuring that there are no environmental or health risks from leakage of radioactive andor toxic elements from the spent nuclear fuel over this time period is both challenging and expen sive, as is apparent in the fact that to date, no functioning deep geological repository for high level spent nuclear fuel has been cre ated any
where in the world 3. In addition, public perception of long term deep geological storage of spent nuclear fuel is generally not positive 4,5. The alternative to deep geological storage for management of nuclear spent nuclear fuel is partitioning and transmutation. Approx. 95 of spent nuclear fuel consists of uranium U and plu tonium Pu Fig. 1, which can be separated from the remainder of the spent fuel and subsequently converted into a Mixed OXide MOX material that can be recycled as fuel 6. Partitioning of spent nuclear fuel to recover the U and Pu has been adopted by many countries with nuclear power capabilities, such as France, Japan, Russia and the United Kingdom 7. In France and Japan, MOX fuel is also being fabricated and reused in light water nuclear reactors 6. This means that more energy is being obtained from material otherwise treated as waste . From this it is clear that separating the U and Pu from the ssion products in spent nuclear fuel can increase the number of years
 nuclear power will be a viable option for power generation. A new class of generation IV fast reactors FRs are currently under development that are able to utilise a greater proportion of the U238 in fuel than generation III reactors due to the higher energy of their fast neutrons 8. These FRs are also able to trans mutate the minor actinides MA americium Am, neptunium Np and curium Cm into less hazardous isotopes. Minor actinides and Pu are the major contributors to the long lifetime and radiotoxic ity of spent nuclear fuel 9, so partitioning out Pu and MA would decrease the radiotoxicity, heat loading, volume and longevity of the remaining waste requiring longterm storage 9,10. For exam ple, the radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel from a light water reactor would take approx. 130 000 years to return to the radiotoxicity level of naturally occurring U without any treatment. However, remov ing all the actinides An from spent nuclear fuel, leaving only the ssion products, would decreas
e this time to 270 years, after which time it would no longer require isolation from the environment 2. Therefore, in addition to increasing the nuclear lifetime, partition ing and transmutation of spent nuclear fuel would dramatically decrease the hazardous nature of nuclear waste requiring long term storage 11. This is bene cial in terms of decreasing risk to the environment and public health as well as decreasing costs due to storing reduced volumes of lower activity waste and increasing public acceptance. In order to decrease the time required to achieve equivalent radiotoxicity to naturally occurring U, selective separation of U, Pu and MA is attractive for reuse andor transmutation in FRs. Indus trial processes for selective separation and recycling of U and Pu are well established. However, in order to transmutate MA they must be separated from the lanthanide ssion products also present in spent nuclear fuel. This separation is necessary because lanthanides Ln are present in sub
stantially greater quantities than MA and, when present their higher neutron absorption crosssection results in preferential absorbtion of neutrons and prevents transmutation of MA 12,13. Lanthanide elements themselves may also be con sidered targets for selective separations due to their importance in materials for clean energy technologies of the future such as wind turbines and electric vehicles, as well as their increasing industrial importance in applications such as catalysts, electronics and phos phors 14,15. Unfortunately, the chemical similarity of Ln and MA makes their partitioning one of the most challenging hydrometal lurgical separations known 16. As a result, no process to separate MA from Ln has yet been implemented on an industrial scale. Recovery of radionuclides such as An from nuclear and industrial wastewater either before or after release into the environment is another important and topical area of research due to their radioac tivity which is often coupled with h
eavy metal toxicity 17 19. Indeed many radionuclides are currently present in environmen tal systems such as oceans and rivers, due predominantly to past nuclear weapons tests 20,21. The radionuclides technetium99, iodine129 and neptunium237 are considered the most critical in terms of environmental contamination due to their long half lives and high mobility 20. However, other actinides such as U, Pu and Am also have long halflives and can be mobile depending on environmental conditions such as pH, redox potential and the presence of complexing ligands 21. In this review, some processes for removal of An and Ln from environmental water systems are described and a summary of the established and developing pro cesses for selective separation of U, Pu and MA from spent nuclear fuel and environmental systems are given. 2. Solvent extraction processes for actinide separation Most commercial and developing processes for actinide sep aration from spent nuclear fuel are presently solvent extr
action processes, as shown in Scheme 1. An organic solvent containing an extractant ligand is contacted with an aqueous solution of spent nuclear fuel, usually dissolved in nitric acid. The organic extractant is chosen or designed to have the chemical ability to selectively partition the desired elements from the aqueous phase into the organic solvent. An ideal extractant should be ef cient, selective, hydrolytically and radiolytically stable, soluble, give fast reaction kinetics and be easily synthesised 22. The ef ciency of extraction is measured using the distribution coef cient Kd, which is the ratio of the concentration of the ana lyte in the organic phase Corg relative to the concentration of the analyte in the aqueous phase Caq after contact. The selectivity of an extractant for one element A over another element B can then be evaluated using the separation factor, SFAB, which is the ratio 268 J.

An organic solvent blue containing organic extractant molecules blue symbols is mixed with an aqueous phase yellow containing metal ions black symbols to increase the surface area of contact between the two phases. The two phases are then again separated, with the extracted ions having moved into the organic phase.

Kd Corg Caq , SFAB Kd A Kd B Extractants composed of only C, H, O and N atoms are often considered preferable in a nuclear context as they do not leave solid, radioactive residues when they are incinerated after being spent 22. The radioactive residues produced from incineration of P and S containing extractants increase the volume of wastes to be processed and stored. This is referred to as the CHON principle. Due to the large number of elements present in spent n
uclear fuel, many varied solvent extraction processes have been devel oped to selectively extract different groups of elements. These processes may be classed into three groups corresponding to the three main sequential solvent extraction processes considered and utilised for treatment of spent nuclear fuel. The initial step is to recover the U and perhaps also Pu for recycling as nuclear fuel. This process is presently performed on an industrial scale using solu tions of spent nuclear fuel dissolved in concentrated nitric acid. Therefore, the subsequent solvent extraction processes involving removal of both MA and Ln together from the remaining ssion products in the raf nate after U and Pu removal must also be per formed with nitric acid as the aqueous phase. The nal step then involves separation of MA from Ln, allowing the isolated MA to be transmutated into less hazardous materials 13. Overviews of the solvent extraction processing technologies, available and pos tulated, for these 
three separations, are detailed in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. 2.1. Separation of uranium and plutonium Currently, commercial reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is car ried out in several countries including France, UK, Russia and Japan using the Plutonium and URanium Extraction PUREX process 7. PUREX is a solvent extraction process utilising the organic ligand tributyl phosphate TBP, 30 in kerosene to selectively extract PuIV and UVI from a solution of spent nuclear fuel dissolved in 3 6 M nitric acid. The chemical structure of the TBP extractant is shown in Fig. 2. Oxalic and hydro uoric acids can be added to pre vent unwanted extraction of molybdenum Mo and zirconium Zr. After the UVI and PuIV are partitioned into the organic phase a reducing agent is added, causing formation of PuIII which is no longer complexed by TBP and can therefore be stripped with clean nitric acid. Uranium is protected from reduction using hydrazine, Fig. 2. Organic extractant tributyl phosphate

Organic extractant N,Ndihexyl octanamide used for U and Pu recovery. and is stripped from the organic phase subsequently at approx. 50 C using dilute nitric acid 7. The extracted PuIV and UVI can then be converted to oxides to make MOX fuel which can be reused in both current generation III reactors or FRs, as described in the introduction. Tributyl phosphate Fig. 2 is considered a good extractant molecule as it is simple, cheap and selective for the tetra and hexa valent An over the tri and pentavalent An. It is also hydrolytically stable under the strong acidic conditions required for this process and is a very effective extractant 7. However, TBP is not radi olytically stable and is degraded, predominantly forming dibutyl phosphate HDBP, over time during the PUREX process 7. This interferes with separation factors between UVIPuIV and other ssion products since HDBP has different extraction behaviour to TBP and a particular af nity for Zr 23. Washi
ng with sodium carbonate can be performed to remove the degradation products. However, this costs time and money, generates waste and also becomes less effective over time. Partitioning of technetium Tc and neptunium Np is also dif cult to control due to the large num ber of possible oxidation states of these elements 7. Finally, as with most solvent extraction processes, PUREX can also encounter problems with third phase formation if the metal loadings are too high. This third phase is a stable emulsion that forms between the organic and aqueous phases during solvent extraction such that the separation is compromised. The formation of HDBP, which is an alkyl phosphoric acid and hence acts as a surfactant, accentuates this problem 23. An alternative to the TBP extractant for recovery of UVI and PuIV from solutions of spent nuclear fuel is N,Ndihexyl octanamide DHOA, Fig. 3 24. This extractant obeys the CHON principle, is readily solubilised in dodecane and does not cause third phase fo
rmation. It has also been shown to exhibit some superior properties to TBP, such as more ef cient PuIV extraction from 3 M nitric acid, lower partitioning of some contaminant elements and more ef cient UVI stripping using 0.01 M nitric acid 24. DHOA is however susceptible to radiolysis, as is TBP. Another alternative to the PUREX process is the URanium EXtraction UREX process whereby PuIV is deported to the raf nate with the remaining transuranic elements and ssion products instead of being extracted with UVI. This process is considered more proliferation resistant than the PUREX process because the PuIV is not isolated at any point 25. As with PUREX, 30 TBP in kerosene is used to extract UVI and PuIV from dissolved spent nuclear fuel. Then, a subsequent scrubbing of the loaded organic phase with 0.5 M acetohydroxamic acid AHA in 0.3 M nitric acid J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 269 Fig. 4. Organic extractant octylphenylN,Ndiisobutyl carbamoylmethylph
os phine oxide, used in the TRUEX process. is used to return the PuIV to the aqueous phase 25 since the AHA forms a strong complex with PuIV but does not extract UVI 26. Substantial amounts of Tc are also extracted with the UVI into the organic phase, so the Tc is stripped using 6 M nitric acid before nal conversion of the UVI to an oxide that can be reused as fuel 25. 2.2. Separation of actinides and lanthanides from other ssion products Minor actinides and Ln are also targets for separation from spent nuclear fuel. Many solvent extraction processes have been devel oped to extract U, Pu, MA and Ln all together. Once these elements are separated from the other ssion products in spent nuclear fuel, further processing to isolate individual elements is simpli ed. Such An Ln extraction processes could be applied directly to solutions of spent nuclear fuel or to PUREX raf nate solutions after U and Pu removal 11. The TRansUranic EXtraction TRUEX process is a modi ed PUREX process in which N
pV and MAIII are extracted as well as UVI and PuIV due to the addition of a carbamoylmethylphos phine oxide CMPO extractant to the organic phase 24. More speci cally, the TRUEX process typically utilises an organic phase consisting of 0.2 M CMPO and 1.2 M TBP in paraf nic hydrocarbon diluent 24. Phosphine oxides such as CMPO are known to form strong complexes with metals under acidic conditions 27 and were developed to overcome the relatively weak metal extraction properties of the carbamoylmethylphosphonate class of extrac tants 28. Lanthanide elements and Tc are also extracted to a certain extent in the TRUEX process, depending on the processing conditions, but selectivity over other ssion products is maintained 29. The TRUEX process has been utilised successfully to decon taminate actinidebearing wastes in the USA, Europe, Japan and India 28. The CMPO derivative typically used in the TRUEX process is octylphenylN,NdiisobutylCMPO, shown in Fig. 4, since it is eas ily synthesised, giv
es high MA distribution coef cients in the nitric acid concentration range 0.5 6 M and can tolerate higher metal loadings than several other CMPO derivatives tested without third phase formation 29. As occurs for the TBP extractant in the PUREX process, CMPO degradation products form during processing which interfere with the desired properties of the process. Therefore, con tact of the used organic phase with macroreticular anionexchange resins to remove the phosphonic and phosphinic acid degrada tion products followed by washing with dilute sodium carbonate Fig. 5.

Organic extractants DMDBTDMA and DMDOHEMA, used in the DIAMEX pro cess. solution as for the PUREX process is required before recycling is possible 29. It has been demonstrated that improved performance of CMPO ligands can be obtained when they are preorganised onto tripodal scaffolds or 
calixarenes 30. For example, improved extraction ef ciency as well as MALn selectivity was observed for CMPO groups attached to calix4arenes or triphenylmethane scaffolds 31. Even small structural changes in the CMPO ligand, such as replacing the methylene bridge with an ethylene group, have been shown to have dramatic impact on extraction performance 32. Of the scaffolds investigated, four CMPO units grafted to the wide rim of calix4arene gave the best extraction results, with partition coef cient KdAm approx. 120 and separation factor SFAmEu approx. 10 for extraction from 3 M nitric acid into dichloromethane 31. Other organophosphorus extractants for An Ln extraction have also been developed, including diisodecylphosphoric acid and trialkylphosphine oxides Fig. 5 7. However, both of these extrac tants have a high af nity for nitrate anions such that at the high nitric acid concentrations relevant to processing of spent nuclear fuel their performance is compromised. Dilution and denit
ri cation of spent nuclear fuel would be necessary prior to utilising these extractants, which is an unattractive option due to the increased volume to be treated and the associated increases in time and cost of the separation process. The DIAMide EXtraction DIAMEX process is another alter native for solvent extraction of An Ln from spent nuclear fuel, in which the CHON principle is applied unlike TRUEX. The extractant in the DIAMEX process can be either a mal onamide, as originally developed in France, or a diglycolamide DGA. The original extractant used was 1 M N, N dimethyl, N, N dibutyl tetradecyl malonamide DMDBTDMA, Fig. 6 in normal paraf nic hydrocarbon diluent, which extracted PuIV UVI AmIII EuIII FeIII TcVII ZrIV from 3 to 4 M nitric acid 33. The extractant coordinated the metal cations via its two carbonyl oxygen atoms 34 and hence dis played the extraction selectivity typical of neutral extractants, attributed to the ionic potential of the actinides 24. It has also been demo
nstrated that while PuIV and AmIII formed complexes with three DMDBTDMA ligands, the complex with UO22 consisted of only two DMDBTDMA ligands 34. For mation of hydrolytic and radiolytic degradation products from DMDBTDMA did not detrimentally affect its extraction perfor mance 24. More recently, a different malonamide derivative N,N dimethyl,N,N dioctylhexylethoxymalonamide DMDOHEMA, Fig. 6 was developed, which exhibited higher lipophilicity and as a result limited third phase phenomena and facilitated removal of degradation products 33. 1 M DMDOHEMA in ndodecane has similar extraction properties to DMDBTDMA except that the pref N O N O O C8H17 C8H17 C8H17 C8H17 Fig. 7. Organic extractant TODGA, used in the DIAMEX process. 270 J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 Fig. 8. Early organic extractants for MALn separation, terpy left and TPTZ right. erential extraction of PuIV over UVI is reversed. Both of these malonamide extractants exhibit KdAm approx. 15 fro
m 4 M nitric acid 33. Another class of diamide extractants used for the DIAMEX process is diglycolamides DGA, which differ from malonamides primarily in that they have an ether oxygen atom between the two amine groups, as shown in Fig. 7. This electron withdrawing oxy gen atom decreases the basicity of the amide groups, making DGA extractants less acid sensitive than malonomides 24. The oxygen atom also provides a third site for coordination of the metal, so that DGA ligands are tridentate, making them more ef cient extractants than the bidentate malonamides 35. As a result, lower concentra tions of DGA extractants are required to achieve ef cient extraction 33. The most commonly used DGA ligand is N,N,N ,N tetraoctyl diglycolamide TODGA, Fig. 7 due to its high solubility in n dodecane and its high af nity for MA 33. Many modi cations of the TODGA ligand at the methylene between the amines and central oxygen or the oxygen itself have been shown to decrease its extraction ef ciency 35. 
Unfortunately, solvent extraction using TODGA requires a phase modi er, usually DHOA or TBP, to reduce third phase formation 33. Speci cally, 0.1 M TODGA with 0.5 M DHOA in ndodecane extracts AmIII EuIII ZrIV PuIV UVI TcVII MoVI SrII with KdAm approx. 300 from 3 M nitric acid. As described above for the CMPO ligand in the TRUEX process, preorganisation of DGA ligands onto tripodal scaffolds has been shown to improve their extraction ef ciency 36,37. CMPO and TODGA ligands have also been modi ed via covalent attachment to cobalt bisdicarbollide anions with diethylene glycol chains in the case of CMPO on a calix4arene scaffold 38,39. For both extractants this resulted in higher extraction ef ciencies than when the ligand and cobalt bisdicarbollide anion were used together without covalent attachment. For the modi ed TODGA ligand the kinetics of extraction and SFEuAm were also enhanced, to 5.6 versus 2.0 from 3 M nitric acid, although the KdEu of 0.6 remained low at this acid concentratio
n 38. More recently, calixarene ana logues called pillar5arenes functionalised with DGA ligands have demonstrated KdEu approx. 40 and SFEuAm of 4.8 from 3 M nitric acid 40. UNiversal EXtraction UNEX is a process for separation of An, Ln, Cs and Sr from other ssion products in spent nuclear fuel. The organic phase is composed of 0.08 M chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide CCD to extract Cs, 0.5 vol polyethylene glycol PEG400 to extract Sr and 0.02 M diphenylN,Ndin butylcarbamoylmethylphosphine Ph2CMPO to extract MA and Ln, in the stable diluent phenyltri uoromethyl sulfone FS13 41. 2.3. Separation of minor actinides from lanthanides Separation of MA from Ln has not yet been achieved industri ally due to the chemical similarity of these two classes of elements. Both MA and Ln are small, hard trivalent cations in solution. Lan thanidesIII generally have coordination numbers of 8 or more and their preferred geometry is tricapped trigonal prism 27. AmIII and EuIII are most commonly used to repre
sent MA and Ln, respectively, when demonstrating selectivity 42. Since transmu tation of the MA elements is the end goal, it is generally considered preferable that selectivity for MA over Ln is demonstrated. Solvent extraction processes designed to separate MA from Ln are typi cally considered for use on PUREX raf nate solutions containing ssion products, including Ln, Cs, Sr, Tc and iodine I, as well as MA. Alternatively, MALn separations may be performed on MA and Ln mixtures produced subsequent to a group An extraction process such as TRUEX or DIAMEX. It has been demonstrated that use of extractants with soft donor atoms such as nitrogen or sulphur can provide MALn selectivity 12,27. The selectivity of soft donor ligands for MA over Ln has been postulated to arise from back donation from the 5f orbitals in the trivalent MA ions to the orbitals in the ligand, leading to cova lency in the bonding that is absent with Ln 22. Nitrogen donors are preferred over sulphur according to the C
HON principle. Less basic nitrogen donors are also preferable as they perform better under the highly acidic conditions of separations on spent nuclear fuel. An alternative strategy for MALn separation is to selectively oxidise the MAIII to the V or VI oxidation state, which would make separation from LnIII possible via a process such as TRUEX. Oxidation of AmIII to AmV or AmVI has been achieved using the peroxydisulfate anion with or without a silver catalyst 43. However, this oxidation has not yet been achieved selectively in the presence of LnIII. Some of the rst solvent extraction ligands developed that demonstrated successful MALn separation SFAmEu 10 were Ndonor ligands including 2,2 :6 ,2 terpyridine terpy and 2,4,6 tripyridyl1,3,5triazine TPTZ, shown in Fig. 8. However, these ligands required the presence of a hydrophobic, anionic syn ergist, such as bromodecanoic acid, to be effective. Also, extraction ef ciencies were poor KdAm 1 at acidities greater than 0.1 M nitric acid fo
r terpy or 1 M nitric acid for TPTZ 22,42. Subsequently extractants based on 2,6bisbenzoxazol 2ylpyridine were developed, which demonstrated superior MALn selectivity to terpy and TPTZ. The highest SFAmEu of 70 was achieved with 0.04 M 2,6bisbenzoxazol2yl42decyl1 tetradecyloxypyridine and 1 M bromodecanoic acid in total petroleum hydrocarbons TPH from 0.1 M nitric acid 44. How ever, the extraction ef ciency at this acid concentration was very J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 271 Fig. 9.

In order to increase extraction af nities, extractant ligands were designed to incorporate both hard Odonor atoms and softer N donor atoms to maintain selectivity. For example, many extractants based on the simple picolinamide moiety have been investigated based on the modest MALn selectivity demonstrated b
y picol inic acid 13. Several dipicolinamide DPA derivatives have been synthesised and the best performing derivative was N,Ndiethyl N,Ndiptolylpyridine2,6dicarboxamide DEDTDPA, Fig. 9, which at a concentration of 0.1 M in chloroform was able to extract Am with Kd 11 and SFAmEu 3.9 from 6 M nitric acid 45, with extrac tion increasing with nitric acid concentration. Adding a second pyridine group to the extractant structure to give 2,2 bipyridine 6,6 dicarboxamides BPDC resulted in increased SFs, but only in the presence of the lipophillic anionic synergist CCD. Directly com parable SFAmEu values for DPA versus BPDC are not available, but 0.03 M N,NdiethylN,NdibenzylBPDC DEDBBPDC, Fig. 9 and 0.01 M CCD in metanitrobenzotri uoride F3 solvent extracted Am from 1 M nitric acid with Kd approx. 7 and SFAmEu approx. 30. For this system, extraction ef ciency decreased with increas ing nitric acid concentration. Therefore it is questionable whether the addition of the second pyridine group was 
bene cial overall. Attaching picolinamide based ligands to a macrocyclic scaffold such as a calixarene can also improve their extraction ef ciency 27,46. From a series of picolinamide bearing calix4arenes, calix6arenes and calix8arenes synthesised by Casnati et al., an upper rim functionalised calix4arene was demonstrated to exhibit the highest MALn selectivity. For this extractant, KdAm approx. 12 and SFAmEu approx. 14 from 0.001 M nitric acid were achieved using 0.01 M extractant and 0.003 M brominated CCD synergist in nitrophenyl hexyl ether 46. However, picolinamide functionalised calixarenes were generally not effective for extrac tions from more acidic solutions pH 2 due to protonation of the extractant 27. A picolinamide functionalised calix6arene Fig. 10, R H demonstrated the highest extraction ef ciency and MALn selectivity during extraction experiments from 0.01 M nitric acid, with 0.005 M extractant and 0.003 M brominated CCD syn ergist in nitrophenyl hexyl ether affording K
dAm approx. 9 and SFAmEu approx. 10 46. Modi cation of picolinamide function alised calixarenes by addition of electron withdrawing groups such as esters to the pyridine of the picolinamide decreases the basicity of the pyridine and as a result can improve extraction from more Fig. 10. Picolinamide functionalised calixarene extractant for MALn separation. acidic solutions 47. For example, 0.001 M methyl ester substituted picolinamide functionalised calix6arene Fig. 10, R COOCH3 with 0.003 M brominated CCD synergist demonstrated KdAm approx. 40 and SFAmEu approx. 3 from 2 M nitric acid. The sulphur based extractant bis2,4,4 trimethylpentyldithiophosphinic acid is the active component of commercial extractant Cyanex 301, shown in Fig. 11, and was originally developed for selective extraction of ZnII 48, but has demonstrated the highest known SFAmEu of approx. 40 000. This SF was achieved using 0.1 M Cyanex 301 0.02 M 2,2 bipyridyl or 0.002 M 1,10phenanthroline in toluene as the organic p
hase, extracting AmIII and EuIII from 1 M NaNO3 0.02 M sulfanilic acid at pH 3.2 49. However, in the absence of the nitrogen donor coextractants this selectivity is dramatically reduced; using 0.5 M Cyanex 301 in kerosene as the organic phase, tracer levels of AmIII and 0.3 M EuIII were extracted from 1 M NaNO3 0.4 M formic acid at pH 3.7 with SFAmEu up to 10 000 50. Although this extractant is able to provide excellent SF values, it is inappropriate for use on realistic solutions of spent nuclear fuel due to its insta bility to oxidising conditions such as the presence of nitric acid. Under these conditions Cyanex 301 is oxidised to form rst Cyanex 302 then Cyanex 272 see Fig. 11. Cyanex 302 demonstrates decreased SFAmEu values and Cyanex 272 preferentially extracts Ln over MA 27. Also, even small amounts of impurities in the organic phase have a dramatic detrimental effect on the separation 48. In order to improve the hydrolytic and radiolytic stability of dithiophosphinic acid extra
ctants, derivatives were prepared with tri uoromethylphenyl side chains 51. These extractants demonstrated improved radiolytic stability since benzene rings can act as energy sinks and prevent radiolysis 42 and the introduction of electron withdrawing tri uoromethyl groups was expected to decrease the pKa of these ligands and hence improve their hydrolytic stability also. These aromatic dithiophos phinic acids demonstrated improved SFAmEu values relative to Cyanex 301 as well as improved stability. In fact, 0.1 M biso tri uoromethylphenyldithiophosphinic acid in FS13 extracted AmIII and EuIII from 0.01 M nitric acid 1 M NaNO3 with SFAmEu of approx. 10 000 at pH 2 51. The position of the tri uoromethyl 272 J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 Fig. 11. Organic extractant Cyanex 301 and its oxidation products Cyanex 302 and Cyanex 272. group on the phenyl ring was observed to have a large impact on the separation performance of the ligand in this work. Furthe
r investigation into the effect of dithiophosphinic acids substitutents on their selectivity using xray absorption spectroscopy XAS and density functional theory DFT has suggested that the presence of ortho groups on the phenyl rings causes steric interactions such that the phenyl rings rotate around the P C bond and the molecu lar symmetry of the extractant is decreased. This in turn increases the energy of the HOMO of the extractant molecule, making it more soft and hence more selective 52. In order to extract MA from Ln under more strongly acidic con ditions, it is possible to use dithiophosphinic acids synergistically with hard donor extractants 53. In fact, under these conditions other An such as U and Pu may also be extracted. For example, 0.5 M bisotri uoromethylphenyldithiophosphinic acid and 0.1 M tri octylphosphine oxide TOPO in toluene selectivity extract U, Pu, Am and Np from 0.3 M nitric acid with Kd 6, while Ln, Cs, Sr, Ba and Rb remained in the aqueous solution with Kd 0
.2 54. In the 1960s at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the USA another process for MALn separation was developed, namely the Triva lent Actinide Lanthanide Separation by Phosphorus Extractants and Aqueous Complexes TALSPEAK process. The TALSPEAK process typically uses 0.5 M di2ethylhexylphosphoric acid D2EHPA in 1,4diisopropylbenzene to extract Ln from an aqueous phase con sisting of 0.05 M diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA in 1 M lactic acid pH approx. 3.5 and can achieve SFEuAm approx. 90 55. The chemical structures of these extractants are shown in Fig. 12. The DTPA is responsible for keeping MA in the aqueous solution, while the lactic acid acts as a buffer as well as improv ing the kinetics of extraction and reducing radiolytic degradation of the DTPA 55,56. Later advancement in the TALSPEAK process involved replacement of D2EHPA and DTPA with 2ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono2ethylhexyl ester HEHEHP and N 2hydroxyethylethylenediamineN,N ,N triacetic acid HEDTA extractants F
ig. 12, respectively, in order to decrease the extrac tion of lactic acid and water into the organic phase during Ln extraction 57, Speci cally, 0.1 M HEHEHP in ndodecane extracted Ln from an aqueous phase consisting of 0.02 M HEDTA in 0.1 M lactate and 1 M nitrate pH 3.6 to afford KdLn approx. 300 and SFAmEu 100. A lower lactate concentration could be used in this modi ed TALSPEAK process because of the improved phase transfer kinetics when using these extractants. This modi ed TAL SPEAK process also extended the pH range in which the MALn separation could be performed pH 2.5 4.0. The pH insensitivity of the HEHEHPHEDTA system, described above, resulted in the use of HEHEHP Fig. 12 in combination with CMPO Fig. 4 or a DGA extractant such as TODGA Fig. 7 for separation of MA and Ln from other ssion products 58 60. Then, Am can be selectively stripped from the loaded organic phase using a polyaminocarboxylic acid such as HEDTA or DTPA Fig. 12 in cit rate buffer, affording MALn separatio
n. This process is referred to as Actinide Lanthanide SEParation ALSEP. The ALSEP process superceded the similar TRUSPEAK concept, which was a combi nation of TRUEX and TALSPEAK, and as such utilised the CMPO and D2EHPA extractants 61. One of the best performing exam ples of the ALSEP process involved using 0.05 M TODGA and 0.75 M HEHEHP in ndodecane to extract Am with Kd approx. 300 and Ln with Kd 10 from 3 M nitric acid 59. In this scenario the HEHEHP acts as a phase modi er and helps prevent third phase formation. Use of CMPO instead of DGA resulted in lower Am extraction ef ciencies from strong nitric acid 1 M and so was not investigated further. Stripping of the MA from the loaded organic was then achieved using 0.025 M DTPA in 0.25 M citrate buffer pH 3.4 4.2, affording KdEu approx. 4 and SFEuAm approx. 70 59. Another class of extractants for MALn separations is the bistriazinyl pyridine BTP and bistriazinyl bipyridine BTBP extractants. These are Ndonor extractants and ful l the 
CHON criteria. Discovery of the solvent extraction properties of the BTP class of extractants 62 represented a breakthrough in MALn sep aration technology as this was the rst class of extractants able to effectively separate MA from Ln in concentrated nitric acid solutions without the use of a synergist 13. This new, desirable property of unassisted extraction from strongly acidic solutions can be explained by the fact that BTP extractants can complex MA as nitrate salts and that they are able to form 1:3 complexes, unlike most other N donor extractants which form 1:2 complexes 22. In fact, extraction of MA increases with nitric acid concentration 42, which has been suggested to result from the fact that protonation of BTP extractants causes them to adopt the cis conformation which is conducive to metal binding 63. BTP ligands were developed before BTBPs and their proper ties depend signi cantly on what substituents are present at the 5,6 positions of the triazinyl rings. It was origin
ally noted that branched alkyl substituents provided superior hydrolytic stability to unbranched substituents since nitric and nitrous acids attacked the CH2 group of the npropyl chain in nPrBTP 22,56. As a result, isopropyl substituents became commonly used iPrBTP, shown in Fig. 13. Using 0.01 M iPrBTP 0.5 M DMDOHEMA in n octanol from 0.5 M nitric acid gave KdAm 9 and SFAmEu 90 22. Extraction from more acidic solutions was more ef cient but less selective. In addition, the extraction kinetics were slow, hydroly sis was extensive in strong 3 M nitric acid and 80 radiolysis occurred upon irradiation with 100 kGy gamma dose 63. This is a signi cant disadvantage given that the annual dose to an organic phase in a MALn separation solvent extraction process plant has been estimated as 100 kGy 1 MGy 42. Later, the annulated ring CyMe4 substituent was developed see Fig. 13. This substituent was designed to eliminate the presence of benzylic hydrogen atoms which cause ring decomposition if att
acked via radiolysis 56. CyMe4BTP demonstrated improved acid stability stable up to 24 h in 3 M nitric acid 63 as well as increased ef ciency and selectivity. Speci cally, 0.01 M CyMe4 BTP 0.5 M DMDOHEMA in noctanol exhibited KdAm approx. 500 and SFAmEu approx. 5 600 from 0.5 M nitric acid. The DMDO HEMA was added as a synergist in order to improve the kinetics of extraction 42 since the radiolytic stability and kinetics of extrac tion were still problematic for CyMe4BTP. In fact, CyMe4BTP demonstrated slower kinetics even that iPrBTP 63. This is in accordance with the general pattern which has been noted that increasing the size and branching of substituents improves their hydrolytic and radiolytic stability but slows their rate of extraction 22,64. The improved hydrolytic stability of branched substituents was explained above and the enhanced radiolytic stability may be attributed for example to abstraction of hydrogen radicals from methylene and methyl groups 56. To address the radi
olytic sta bility of CyMe4BTP, a scavenger molecule such as nitrobenzene can J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 273 Fig. 12. Organic extractants D2EHPA left top, HEHEHP left bottom, DTPA right top and HEDTA right bottom used in the TALSPEAK process. Fig. 13. Organic BTP extractants used for MALn separation. be included in the organic phase of the solvent extraction system 42. Alternatively, a conjugated ring can be appended to the CyMe4 group to give BzCyMe4BTP, as shown in Fig. 13 63. As mentioned above, conjugated rings such as nitrobenzene and benzene can act as radical scavengers or as energy sinks and hence are able to help prevent radiolysis 12,42. However, this additional conjugated ring decreased the ef ciency and selectivity of MA extraction. For 0.01 M extractant 0.5 M DMDOHEMA in noctanol from 0.5 M nitric acid, KdAm was 500 and SFAmEu 1600 for CyMe4BTP while KdAm was 10 and SFAmEu 600 for BzCyMe4BTP 63. The high extraction ef ciencies of BTPs
 can be problematic as it causes stripping of the metal from the organic phase to become extremely challenging 42. This is a major problem since it pre vents recycling of the organic solvent. Due to the prohibitively high extraction ef ciencies of CyMe4BTP, the BTBP extractant, shown in Fig. 14, was developed 42. In terms of radiolytic stability, CyMe4 BTBP Fig. 14 has been shown to withstand up to 20 kGy dose 42, which would allow it to survive approximately two months in a MALn separation solvent extraction process plant. The kinetics of extraction was still slow using CyMe4BTBP, for example extraction N N N N N N N N Fig. 14. Organic extractant CyMe4BTBP used for MALn separation. with 0.02 M CyMe4BTBP in octanol from 0.5 M nitric acid required more than 30 min to reach equilibrium 65. Therefore addition of DMDOHEMA to the organic phase to act as a phase transfer agent was still bene cial, as with BTP extractants. However, increasing the DMDOHEMA concentration above 0.25 M caused a d
ecrease in SFAmEu since the DMDOHEMA itself extracts MA and Ln non selectively 65. Using 0.01 M CyMe4BTBP and 0.25 M DMDOHEMA 274 J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 Fig. 15. Organic extractant CyMe4BTPhen used for MALn separation. in octanol as the organic phase resulted in KdAm approx. 10 and SFAmEu approx. 120 from 1 M nitric acid within 5 min of mixing. Successful MALn separation has been demonstrated on a radioactive spent fuel solution using CyMe4BTBP. After PUREX and DIAMEX processing, a 2 M nitric acid aqueous solution containing MA and Ln underwent 9 extractions with 0.015 M CyMe4BTBP and 0.25 M DMDOHEMA in noctanol to give a MA stream containing less than 0.1 Ln 66. However, a slow ow rate was required due to the poor kinetics of the extractant and the loading capacity of the organic was also limited, making this MALn separation process nonideal for industrial use 66. It has been hypothesised that the reason for the slow kinetics of extraction b
y CyMe4BTBP could be that the more energeti cally favourable trans conformation must transform into the cis conformation in order to coordinate metal cations 67. Therefore the 2,2 bipyridine moiety of the BTBP extractant was replaced with 1,10phenanthroline, affording the quadridentate bistriazine extractant, CyMe4BTPhen Fig. 15, which is locked into a cis con formation. Solvent extraction studies with CyMe4BTPhen showed that it was able to quickly, effectively and selectively extract MA from Ln in concentrated nitric acid solutions without the use of a synergist, making it a highly suitable candidate for use under MALn separation processing conditions. Speci cally, 0.01 M CyMe4BTPhen in octanol extracted Am from 1 M nitric acid with Kd approx. 1 000 and SFAmEu approx. 300 67. This KdAm value is approx. two orders of magnitude greater than was achieved using CyMe4BTBP and the SF is also greater. Despite the high af nity of CyMe4BTPhen for MA, back extraction was possible using glycolic
 acid 13. In terms of kinetics, extraction of Am reached equilibrium within approx. 15 min without the use of a phase transfer agent 67. Furthermore, CyMe4BTPhen was more soluble in 1octanol than CyMe4BTBP 13. 3. Solid materials for actinide separations Currently, most commercial or proposed processes for actinide separation from spent nuclear fuel are performed using solvent extraction techniques, many of which are described in Section 2. However, use of solid sorbent materials as an alternative to sol vent extraction, as shown in Scheme 2, has many advantages. These include the avoidance of organic solvents which removes prob lems associated with chemical and radiolytic degradation of the diluent such as reduced performance and secondary waste gener ation 22,68, faster kinetics in many cases 64, the fact that the extractant molecule does not need to be designed to be soluble in an organic phase or obey the CHON principle, a phase modi er is never required and there is no possibility 
of third phase formation. Thus, using solid sorbent materials reduces the complexity of actinide separations relative to solvent extraction, which in turn reduces the time and cost required. In addition, the complexity necessarily introduced when designing a solvent extraction process can some times have negative consequences to the separation performance. For example, adding long chain alkyl groups to extractants in order to increase their solubility in organic diluents can make them more susceptible to protonation 42, reduce their extraction ef ciency 36 or cause undesirable aggregation at the solvent interface dur ing extraction 27. One nal advantage of solid phase materials as sorbents for nuclear separations is that after loading with radionu clides the material can potentially be used as a wasteform precursor or transmutation matrix. Thus the time and cost associated with the extra processing steps of stripping and oxide conversion can be avoided. Many materials have been develop
ed in which extractant lig ands used in solvent extraction processes are incorporated into solidphase materials in order to produce sorbent materials for actinide separations from spent nuclear fuel. The extractant lig and is impregnated or coated onto solid support structures such as polymer resins, porous silica, polymer membranes, metal oxide particles, clays, carbonbased materials or magnetic nanoparti cles 13,69,70. However, there are very few examples of solid phase materials used for nuclear separations at industrial or pilot scales 71. Selected examples of materials with extractant ligands impregnated in polymer resins, silica or carbon materials are given in Table 1 69. In order to develop a sorbent material for nuclear separa tions, several factors must be considered. For example, sorbents for selective separation of targeted elements from highly acidic aque ous solutions of irradiated nuclear fuel should preferably exhibit favourable hydrolytic and radiolytic stability, as w
ell as chemi cal stability. It is considered preferable for solid phase sorbents to have open, porous structures in order to provide high surface areas which result in more active sites per gram of material high capac ity and facilitate rapid mass transport fast kinetics 73. In order for a solid phase sorbent to be practically useful in a owthrough column setup, it should also have a granular physical form with a particle size large enough to prevent issues with loss of pressure and clogging 74. 3.1. Silica based sorbents Many examples exist of organic extractant molecules from sol vent extraction processes being incorporated into silica based solid sorbent materials. Some examples were given in Table 1. The rel ative ease of porous silica synthesis has led to a variety of silica based sorbent materials being used for nuclear separations, includ ing porous silica loaded with extractant impregnated polymers 75, functionalised via silanes 18 or magnetised via incorpora tion of iron oxide
 76. However, silica based materials are not ideal for separations in a nuclear context as they demonstrate relatively poor hydrolytic 77 and radiolytic 78 stability. Extractants including but not limited to BTP, TODGA, CMPO, DTPA have been impregnated into a styrenedivinylbenzene poly mer Fig. 16 which is in turn embedded into porous silica particles to make sorbent materials SiO2P for selective MA extraction or separation of Ln and An from simulated high level waste 68,71,79 81. Calix4arenecrown impregnated SiO2P materials have also been developed for selective Cs extraction from nitric acid solutions 82. These materials were able to perform the desired separations, for example iBuBTP impregnated SiO2P achieved KdAm approx. 20 000 and SFAmGd approx. 70 from 3 M nitric acid 79 and CMPO impregnated SiO2P achieved KdLn approx. 50 with selectivity SF 50 over Na, K, Cs, Sr, Ba and Ru 68. However, since the extractants are anchored to the solid via intermolecular forces only in these mater
ials, the extractant leaks relatively easily J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 275 Scheme 2. Separation processing using solid phase sorbent materials. An aqueous solvent containing a mixture of elements is owed through a column containing the sorbent material. The targeted element is extracted and remains embedded in the solid, while the remaining elements and liquid pass through. Table 1 Solidphase extractants used for preconcentration of An and Ln 69,72.

For example, treating TODGASiO2 P with 3 M nitric acid at 80 C for 100 h or irradiation with 3 MGy gamma dose decreased the amount of neodymium Nd sorbed by this material by more than half 80. Similar decreases in sorption capacity upon gamma irradiation were seen for CMPOSiO2P 71. More sophisticated solid phase materials for separations can be synthesised by functionalisation of silica based framework materials via covalent silane anchor groups 18,83,84. These sil ica framework materials have previously been synthesised with ordered or disordered porosity. Sever
al carboxylate and phospho nate functionalised disordered porous silica materials have been shown to extract Ln from pH 3 6 aqueous solutions 85. These materials were then fused via heat treatment to immobilise the Ln ions within the structure and produce a glass wasteform. Sil ica gel functionalised with carboxylate appended macrocycles has also been show to successfully decontaminate solutions of U, Pu and Am 86 and malonamide functionalised mesoporous silica has been shown to extract PuIV AmIII LnIII from 3.5 M nitric acid 87. Functionalised ordered porous silica frameworks have been synthesised in the form of selfassembled monolayers on meso porous supports SAMMS and used for separation of radionuclides present in spent nuclear fuel 88 91. For example, a silica SAMMS functionalised with acetamide phosphonate Fig. 17 was shown to extract EuIII from 3 M nitric acid with Kd approx. 200 and selectiv ity over divalent transition metal cations as well as K and Ca at pH 2 90. This same ma
terial was shown to extract PuIV from 0.1 M nitric acid1 M sodium nitrate with Kd approx. 20 000 and selec tivity over a variety of di, tri and tetravalent metal cations 91. In addition, silica SAMMS functionalised with hydroxypyridinones 276 J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 Fig. 17. Acetamide phosphonate left and hydroxypyridinone right ligands used for functionalisation of silica SAMMS. Fig. 18. Silane functionalised, silica coated magnetic nanoparticles. Fig. 17 were able to selectively extract PuIV and UVI from acidic solutions 88. PlutoniumIV was extracted from 0.1 M nitric acid1 M sodium nitrate with Kd approx. 80 000 and selectivity over Fe, Al, Zr and Mo, while UVI was extracted from 0.2 M nitric acid with Kd approx. 4 000 selectivity not reported. However, selfassembled monolayers of organosilanes on silica surfaces have been shown to undergo radiolysis upon gamma doses of 500 kGy 92. Magnetic nanoparticles are another alternative solid phase 
sor bent that has been investigated for separations at the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, as they allow easy separation of the solid and liquid phases using magnetic elds 76. Magnetic silica particles, consisting of iron oxide in porous silica Fig. 18, coated in star burst dendrimers with terminal amino groups were functionalised with CMPO, picolinamide or DGA ligands to produce materials for MALn separations from pH 1 nitric acid 93. The picolinamide functionalised particles performed poorly at this low pH, but CMPO and DGA functionalised materials afforded KdAm of 80 or 200 and SFAmEu 2 or 0.4, respectively. Another example of dendrimer coated magnetic silica particles functionalised with tripodal CMPO ligands showed the opposite selectivity under the same sorption conditions; Eu was extracted preferentially over Am, with KdAm 60 and SFAmEu 0.3 94. Silica coated magnetic nanoparticles func tionalised with CyMe4BTPhen have also been used for MALn separation and were able to achie
ve KdAm 623 and SFAmEu 65 from 1 M nitric acid 95. 3.2. Polymer resins Extraction chromatographic resins consisting of extractant molecules immobilised in nonreactive macroporous polymer sup ports have also been widely adopted for separations at the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle 71, although they are more com monly used for analytical purposes than fullscale processing due to their chemical instability 28. An example of an extraction chro matographic resin being used for processing of spent nuclear fuel solutions is the Plutonium and Uranium Recovery On CHROMato graphic EXtraction columns PUROCHROMEX process. This is a solid phase version of the PUREX process whereby light water reac tor fuel dissolved in 5 6 M nitric acid is passed through a silica column followed by three columns consisting of 60 wt TBP in polystyrenedivinylbenzene copolymer beads 71. The major con Fig. 19. Chemical structure of polymer resins; acrylic ester polymer left, polyacry lonitrile middle and polystyren
e right. cern with this process was the hydrolytic and radiolytic instability of the polymeric sorbents. Extractant molecules may either be impregnated into polymer resins via intermolecular forces or covalent attachment. Covalent attachment of extractant ligands to the polymer support may be considered preferable as it minimises loss of the extractant dur ing processing, but the alternative of physical impregnation is a simpler and more versatile option 96. Some examples of impreg nated materials were given in Table 1. In addition to this list, Cyanex 301 has been impregnated into various polymers including an alginate biopolymer 71, styrenedivinylbenzene resins XAD 4 and Chromosorb 102, and acrylic ester resin XAD7 Fig. 19 96. A transuranic speci c TRU Spec resin composed of CMPO and TBP impregnated in Amberchrom CG71 acrylic ester resin beads has demonstrated extraction of PuIV and NpIV with Kd approx. 105, ThIV with Kd approx. 104, UVI with Kd approx. 103 and AmIII with Kd approx. 
102 from 1 to 4 M nitric acid 97. Selectivity over TcVII and FeIII in this acidity range was also demonstrated. CMPO has also been impregnated into several other polymer matrices including polyacrylonitrile PAN, Fig. 19, poly acrylate and polystyrene Fig. 19 and the sorption performance of the resulting materials investigated 96. The differing extraction ef ciencies and sorption kinetics of these various CMPO impreg nated materials demonstrated that the choice of polymer matrix can have a signi cant impact on sorption performance, which can be attributed to differences in the porosity and functionality of the polymer frameworks. TODGA impregnated into Amberchrom CG 71 resin beads demonstrated extraction of PuIV, ThIV, AmIII and LnIII from 1 4 M nitric acid with Kd 103 104 and equilibrium was reached within 10 min 98. Hydrolytic stability and selectivity over SrII, FeIII and AlIII was also demonstrated for this resin, but selectivity over ZrIV was poor from 4 M nitric acid. In terms of 
covalently functionalised polymer resins, Merri eld chloromethylated styrenedivinylbenzene resin has been cova lently modi ed with CMPO and the resulting material was able to sorb Ln with Kd approx. 100 as well as UVI and ThIV with Kd approx. 1000 from 4 M nitric acid within 10 min 99. Separation of these elements was then possible using various eluents. Other examples of covalently functionalised polymer resins for sorp tion of An and Ln from concentrated nitric acid solutions include malonamide and phosphonic acid functionalised polystyrene 96. The commercial resin Diphonix, which is a styrenedivinylbenzene sulfonated ionexchange resin containing gemdiphosphonic acid groups Fig. 20, has been shown to be able to extract UVI, ThIV, J.

PuIV, NpV and AmIII with Kd values greater than 100 from 0.1 10 M nitric acid 100. The demonstra
ted ability of Diphonix to extract An from highly acidic solutions was attributed to the presence of the diphosphonic acid groups. Gamma irradiation of some polymer resins, including Diphonix, with 0.25 2 MGy in nitric acid was observed to decrease their ef ciency or capacity. However, the kinetics of sorption by the polymer resins were relatively unaffected by gamma irradiation, while silica based sorbents that were also evaluated exhibited both decreased ef ciency and kinetics of sorption upon irradiation 102. 3.3. Metal oxide materials Group IV metal oxides such as titania and zirconia demonstrate superior hydrolytic and radiolytic stability to silica and polymer based materials 78,102,103, which provides them with an advan tage as framework materials for separations in a nuclear context. Titania or zirconia based sorbents could also potentially be used, postsorption, for immobilisation or as transmutation matrices 104. Organofunctionalised group IV metal oxide sorbent materi als ar
e substantially less common than their silica or polymer resin counterparts, but examples do exist 105 109. In most cases the desired functional group is anchored to the surface by ionic bond ing of phosphate, phosphonate or carboxylate groups 84,110. An example of this surface complexation is shown in Fig. 21 for a phosphonate group. One form of bridging bidentate coordination is shown in Fig. 21 but monodentate or tridentate coordination are also possible 111. Phosphate or phosphonate groups are con sidered preferable to carboxylate groups as they bind to titania and zirconia with superior strength and selectivity 105,106,112. However, grafting of monophosphonate groups has relatively lit tle utility unless the phosphonate provides unbound groups for potential binding to metal cations. Therefore, polyphosphonate functionalised metalIV oxide materials have been developed as ionexchange materials. These materials have the potential to offer strong surface anchoring via multiple phospho
nate groups but at the same time free phosphonate or other functional groups useful for cation binding 105. It has also been shown that polyphospho nates bound to zirconia surfaces mitigate leaching of framework elements 113. Fig. 21. One possible con guration of a phosphonate group grafted to a titania surface. Fig. 22. Diethylene triamine pentamethylene phosphonate used for functionaliza tion of titania and zirconia to produce sorbent materials. Post synthetic grafting of functional groups to metal oxide sur faces has the disadvantage that the limited surface functionality of the metal oxide materials limits the capacity of the material for the functional group and hence for the species of interest to be sorbed. In many cases even monolayer coverage cannot be achieved, par ticularly for bulk materials, due to inaccessibility of the pores to the grafting molecule andor pore blockage by strong grafting groups 114,115. An alternative method of synthesis for functionalised metal oxide ma
terials is cocondensation of the metal oxide and functional group such that the functional group is incorporated into the structure of the material. Via this strategy, if the molar ratio of the functional group ligand to Zr or Ti is greater than 1, a large number of available functional groups should be produced which are able to bind metal cations from solution. For example, titanium phosphate or zirconium phosphatephosphonate materials synthe sised by cocondensation have been shown to ef ciently extract U from nitric acid solutions with pH 1 116 and to extract Pu, Np and Nd from pH 2 nitric acid 109. Zirconium phosphonate mate rials have been shown to extract Ln selectively over Cs, Sr and Co at pH 1 with high capacity and fast kinetics 117. Also, titanium and zirconium phosphonates synthesised using diethylene triamine pentamethylene phosphonate Fig. 22 have demonstrated extrac tion of ThIV, UVI and to a lesser extent LnIII from 0.2 M nitric acid 118. Independent of their synthesis 
method, all phosphonate func tionalised metal oxide materials suffer the disadvantage that under strongly acidic conditions, such as are required for An separation from spent nuclear fuel, some phosphonate groups are cleaved from the surface of titania and zirconia materials 119. As an alternative, covalent attachment of an organic extractant to the surface of tita nia via a longchain alkene that selfassembles on the surface has been used to produce materials for actinide separations Fig. 23. Titania nanoparticles covalently functionalised with an alkylamine R NH2 in Fig. 23 were shown to selectively extract U in the pres ence of Cs, Sr and Ln at pH 2.5 120. These covalently functionalised titania nanoparticles were hydrolytically stable at pH 2 for 24 h. Similarly, hierarchically porous titania beads functionalised with a 278 J.

nd demonstrated MALn separation with KdAm 159 and SFAmEu 159 from pH 2 nitric acid 121. 4. Environmental remediation Typically solid phase sorbent materials are more effective for preconcentration or analysis of dilute environmental radionuclide solutions than solvent extraction 13. Solvent extraction processes are impractical for environmental cleanup due to the large volumes of aqueous solutions involved as well as the requirement to perform the separation onsite . An investigation of An and Ln removal from freshwater and seawater environments using conventional ionexchange and chelating resins versus SAMMS and nanoporous manganese diox ide particles showed that 3,4hydroxypyridinone functionalised SAMMS and small manganese dioxide particles exhibited the most consistent high ef ciency sorption 19. Many polymeric resins for An and Ln separation from environmental samples have also been developed 96,122,123. For example, the Dipex resin is a commercially available extraction chromatogr
aphic resin consist ing of bis2ethylhexylmethanediphosphonic acid impregnated into Amberchrom CG71 ms acrylic ester resin beads which can effectively extract An including UVI, ThIV, PuIV and AmIII from chloride solutions with varying acidity 122. Selectivity for AmIII over potential interfering cations such as FeIII and AlIII was also demonstrated by this resin. Several carbonbased nanomaterials have also been inves tigated for environmental remediation of radionuclides 81,124 126. Some of these studies have used density func tional theory DFT to probe the interaction between An ions and solid surfaces in order to develop more ef cient materials for actinide separations. For example, PuIV was demonstrated to have a higher af nity for graphene oxide GO functionalised with hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl or epoxy groups than PuVI and NpV, which could be explained by a higher covalency in the bonding between PuIV and the coordinating oxygen atoms of the GO 124. Insight into the binding of th
e uranyl cation to GO functionalised with hydroxyl, carboxylic acid or epoxy groups was also provided by DFT and EXAFS analysis. For example abstraction of hydroxyl groups from the GO surface and subsequent sorption of the UOHO22 species was indicated by DFT 125. A variety of other sorbent materials, including functionalised mesoporous silica 127,128, metalorganic frameworks MOFs 129, ion exchange and chelating resins 130 have also been investigated for U extraction. 5. Conclusions In this review, an overview of solvent extraction, adsorption and ionexchange processes that have been developed for separating U, Pu, Np, Am and Cm from solutions of spent nuclear fuel has been given. Separation of U, Pu and Np can be facilitated by their oxida tion states IV, V and VI, which are higher than most other ssion products. On the other hand separation of Am and Cm, which are trivalent, from the trivalent Ln also present in spent nuclear fuel, is more challenging. Solvent extraction methods for A
n separation have a long his tory and are better established than the use of solid phase materials. In this review, solvent extraction methods were divided into three categories; U and Pu separation, combined An and Ln separation and MA separation from Ln. In order to isolate MA, these three separation processes must be performed sequentially. In terms of U and Pu separation, the PUREX process is used commercially to achieve this. For combined An and Ln separation, both the TRUEX and DIAMEX processes are well established but only the DIAMEX extractant obeys the CHON principle. Finally, extensive research has led to development of the BTP and BTBP extractants which arguably demonstrate the best properties for MA separation from Ln. Solid phase materials for separation of actinides have also been developed and have some advantages over solvent extrac tion methods, most notably the lack of organic solvents required. Currently, solid phase materials are predominantly utilised for environme
ntal applications at nearneutral pH, or preconcen tration of An from dilute solutions in order to enable analysis. However, in some cases they also demonstrate potential for use in concentrated, acidic systems such as the treatment of spent nuclear fuel. In this review, solid phase materials for separation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel were divided into three classes; silica, poly mers and metal oxides. In many cases porous silica, polymer or metal oxide framework materials were simply impregnated with organic extractant molecules known from solvent extraction meth ods, such as TBP or CMPO. Covalent attachment of these ligands to the framework material imparted greater chemical and radiolytic stability than use of intramolecular forces. Actinide separation methods at the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle are important because they allow control and minimisation J. VeliscekCarolan Journal of Hazardous Materials 318 2016 266 281 279 of the hazards, both to the environment and to 
human health, posed by longterm storage of radioactive materials. Separation of actinides to close the nuclear fuel cycle also has the additional ben e t of improving the sustainability of nuclear power. Continued research into processes to separate actinides from concentrated, multielement, acidic solutions is critical in order to develop and improve treatment of spent nuclear fuel.
